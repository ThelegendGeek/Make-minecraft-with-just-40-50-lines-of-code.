Hey!! Welcome!!

This respioratery will show you to make a game somewhat similar to minecraft with just 40 to 50 lines of code. Earlier I made this same game with like a thousand lines of code in Unity, since a game similar to minecraft can't be made with just 40 to 50 lines of code, we have to import a lot of things so make sure to give credits!! You don't need any software like Unity or any IDE. You can make this game in a normal text editor like VS code or Sublime text through Python.


Final look would be like this-

I hope you find this helpul !!!
